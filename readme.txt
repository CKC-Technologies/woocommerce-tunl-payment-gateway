To get your *API Key* and *Secret*, log in to your [Tunl Merchant Account](https://merchant.tunl.com/session/signin) and navigate to your *Settings* page by clicking on the gear icon in the left menu bar. Scroll down and select *Create API Key*. Name your key something like “WooCommerce Key” and make sure that the *Active* field is set to *Write*. Click *Create*.
